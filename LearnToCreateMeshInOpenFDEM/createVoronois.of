# of.geometry.square 'rock' x [minvalue, maxvalue] y [minvalue, maxvalue], at here, bracket and comma are not mandatory, but strongly recommend you do like this or 
# of.geometry.square 'rock'  [x_minvalue, x_maxvalue, y_minvalue, y_maxvalue], at here, the values in the bracket should strictly follow the order and the bracket is
