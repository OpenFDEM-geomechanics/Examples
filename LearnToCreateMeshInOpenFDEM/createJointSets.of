# of.geometry.square 'rock'  [x_minvalue, x_maxvalue, y_minvalue, y_maxvalue], at here, the values in the bracket should strictly follow the order and the bracket is

# you are required to define a domain you are going to use jsets or DFNs, the random joints will be created in the range of domain
# you can create gauss random distributed, uniform distributed and constant(equal distance) joints by changing the keywords of dip, space, trace and gap
# if you do not use the start point command, the jsets will start by random, maybe the jsets will be not located at where you wants, therefore, try to use
# start point if it is possible, but be sure that for the dip angle ranging [0-90], the start point should be located at the left-up corner
# and for the dip range of [90-180], the start point should be at the down-left corner, the start point should not ON or OUT the domain range
# please remember to assign the minsize and minangle values to delete the bad joints, which may cuase bad mesh, by default, the minsize is 0.0 and minangle is 20
